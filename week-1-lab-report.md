1. `cd` - Change Directory


    An example using the command with no arguments:

    > **Working Directory:** `/home`
    >
    > *Passing no argument to the `cd` command means that the directory changes to itself and therefore the directory is unchanged, as can be observed on the `~` portion of the prompt.*
    
    An example with using the command with a path to a directory as an argument:
   
    <img width="666" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Bexhlee/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/152840466/aa11be8b-d3ae-4a26-8863-7d0fe9063aff">

    > **Working Directory:** `/home`
    >
    > *Passing a path to a valid folder in the working directory to the 'cd' command allows the current directory to change to the listed folder. On the prompt, we can see that the directory has successfully changed to `/lecture1`*
    
    An example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument:
   
    <img width="666" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Bexhlee/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/152840466/2d3be735-af4e-4454-9ec9-bb22731a0e2c">

    > **Working Directory:** `/lecture1`
    >
    > *Passing a path to a file to the `cd` file generates an error mesage beacuse it is not a valid directory. The working directory in the prompt afterwards remains unchanged because the `cd` command terminates due to the error


2. `ls` - Lists Current Directory
  
    An example using the command with no arguments:

    > **Working Directory:** `/lecture1`
    >
    > *Passing no argument to the `cd` command means that the directory changes to itself and therefore the directory is unchanged, as can be observed on the `~` portion of the prompt.*
